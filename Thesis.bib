@article{Louzoun2007,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Sciences1995,
abstract = {Infectious diseases continue to have a major impact on individuals, populations, and the economy, even though some of them have been eradicated (e.g. small pox). Unlike many other ecological systems, many infectious diseases are well documented by spatio-temporal data sets of occurrence and impact. In addition, in particular for childhood diseases, the dynamics of the disease in a single individual are fairly well understood and fairly simple. As such, infectious diseases are a great field for mathematical modeling, and for connecting these models to data. In this article, we concentrate on three issues, namely (1) comparative childhood disease dynamics and vaccination, (2) spatio-temporal disease dynamics, and (3) evolution in diseases with multiple strains. The mathematical techniques used in the analysis of disease models contain bifurcation theory for ODEs, wavelet analysis, stochastic simulations and various forms of data fitting. These lecture notes stem from a series of four lectures by Bryan Grenfell as a PIMS distinguished visitor at the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary in the fall of 2003. While none of the individual results presented here is new (and we will give ample reference), the summary and comparative view is meant to give a brief introduction and overview of a subject that has been a hot research topic in recent years. The following is not meant as an exhaustive review of the relevant literature. More references and technical information are given on: General introductions to the subject are given by Anderson and May (1981) and Grenfell and Dobson (1995).},
